In the end I am prod of the end result. This was my first experience of mobile development. Use of a state management tool like _Bloc_ would have been useful indeed it would have make the entire development process easier, nevertheless _Flutter_ is a fun tool to use, with a lot of points in favor and its popularity is well deserved.
